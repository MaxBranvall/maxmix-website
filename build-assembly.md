## Assembly
1. Grab the ring and place it it on the top of the enclosure, aligning the notches on the sides and making sure that the extra notch is facing the display.
2. Bring the top and bottom parts together until they snap in place.
3. Slide the knob on the shaft of the rotary encoder.
4. Turn it upside down and use the 4 countersink screws to secure the two halves together.
