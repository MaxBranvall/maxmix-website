## Release 0.10.4

A much desired feature by the communitty is the ability to control the master volume.  
This latest release brings you just that!  

For the developers out there, this release also includes a pretty major refactoring of the firmware that makes
the code more readable and easy to manage.

Go download it [Release 0.10.4](https://github.com/t3knomanzer/maxmix-software/releases/download/0.10.4/Maxmix.0.10.4.msi) or let the auto-updater take care of it for you next time you launch the application.

Remember to also update the device from the firmware installer.
