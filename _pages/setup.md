## Overview
MaxMix is comprised of two pieces of software, the desktop application and the device firmware, you can download both of them below.

## Desktop app
_It is recommended that you install the desktop application before you plug-in your device for the first time since it will also install the necessary device drivers._

1. Download the application, run the downloaded executable and follow the instructions on the screen.  
2. Plug-in your device now and wait for Windows to recognize it.  
3. Launch the application either from the **start menu** or the **desktop shortcut**.

The application should now be running and in the **windows taskbar**. 

If you purchased the device from the store, it will come with the firmware already installed so you can start using it right away, if not, read below how to install it yourself.

## Firmware
