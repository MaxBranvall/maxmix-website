## Overview
MaxMix is open source software and hardware, contributing to it's development is very easy.

There are four areas to which you can contribute, all described below.  
I only ask you to read the contribution guidelines and licenses for repositories.

Not a developer? No problem! Support by [donating](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=SQS6XJZBCBZA8&currency_code=USD&source=url) to the project!

## Desktop app
Are you into Windows desktop application programming?  
The desktop app is written in C# and WPF.
